# randomPasswordGenerator

sometimes google chrome's 'suggest password' does not show up when creating new accounts.

this is a random password generator so in case i run into this inconvenience, i can quickly just run this script and generate a password and have it copied to my clipboard instead of me coming up with my own password

configured environment variable and have it run with by just pressing Windows+R and typing "generate.py", pretty handy.
